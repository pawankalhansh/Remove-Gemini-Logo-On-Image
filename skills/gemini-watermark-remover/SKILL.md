For file processing in an agent workflow:

- identify the input path
- choose an explicit output path or output directory before execution
- if the user did not specify output location, decide it first and tell the user where files will be written
- run one of:
  - `node scripts/run.mjs remove <input> --output <file>`
  - `node scripts/run.mjs remove <input-dir> --out-dir <dir>`
- report the written output path
